# dataset_reiden_multishot
 dataset_factory

This repository contains one group of functions in C++

- data_factory_from_reid_multi: generation of pairs from Re-Identification datasets with the division of the samples in train, validation and test sets, according to the protocol described by described in [3].

The outputs are data txt files with labels, suitable for blobs creation to train deep networks with caffe.

<br />
Then, there is a set of scripts to create the blobs from the datasets using the generated data files (with the previous functions)
- blobs_creation: generate caffe data blobs

<br />
